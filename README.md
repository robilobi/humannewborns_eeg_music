Summary
============================
The ability to track rhythmic and melodic structures in music is considered a fundamental human trait, present across all cultures and predating linguistic comprehension in human development. 
Yet, the tendency to study melody and rhythm in isolation has obscured the biological constraints underpinning music processing from birth. 
	The present EEG study bridges the gap. We used temporal response functions to assess rhythmic and melodic neural encoding in newborns (N = 49) exposed to classical music and shuffled control stimuli. We computationally quantified context-based melodic and rhythmic expectations and dissociated these higher-level processes from lower-level acoustic tracking, such as local changes in the timing and pitch. 
With respect to rhythm, we found similar tracking of lower-level timing information in real and shuffled music but encoding of probabilistic rhythmic expectations only in real music, providing evidence of newborns’ ability to rely on rhythmic statistical regularities to generate expectations. With respect to melody, we found minimal to no tracking of melodic information, whether in relation to local pitch changes or probabilistic pitch expectations, suggesting a dampening of this dimension compared to the rhythmic one in the newborn brain. 
This study provides compelling neurophysiological evidence that the capacity to track rhythmic statistical regularities is present at birth. It also suggests that melodic tracking, in contrast, may be upweighted through development with exposure to behaviourally relevant signals, such as speech and music.
